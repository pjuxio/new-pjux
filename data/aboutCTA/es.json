Their calling, like that of so many artists before them fleeing violence and persecution, was to create art out of war in the nation’s capital.</p><p>The film follows <strong>poet Quique Aviles</strong> in his journey to find answers and healing from the traumatic events that led to his migration north. That journey leads Quique to write “Las Muertes Más Bellas del Mundo,” a powerful, heart-wrenching poem forty years in the making. His goal: to reclaim his dead and the dignity of a nation torn apart by war and mass displacement. Threaded within Quique’s journey are portraits of <strong>Salvadoran-Wachintonian artists</strong> whose oral histories and archival images tell an intimate story of a community resolving trauma to find identity, belonging, and joy in their new home. Collectively, they uplift the power of art to heal in a world fraught with legacies of injustice.</p>",
